# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance
Spring Semester 2018

## Deliverable 3

In this deliverable, you and a partner will write software to verify if a simple blockchain is valid.

The program shall accept one argument, which is the name of a file which should contain a valid Billcoin blockchain (see billcoin.md in this directory).  Your program will read in and either determine if it is valid (in which case you should print out all of the address which have billcoins and how many), or invalid (in which case you should print out what the error is).

The program shall be written in Ruby and called verifier.rb.
