# Fall2018 CS1555 My Auction
Repo for University of Pittsburgh CS1555 My Auction Project for Fred Erlenbusch

This project was to design a database system in Oracle SQL for an, ebay like, Auction app. The main focus of this project was the SQL and only required a command line interface, but I took the opportunity to instead do a quick interface in JavaFX.
